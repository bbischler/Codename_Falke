        <div class="header"> 1. Aim of the game</div>
        The object of Cricket is to close all numbers from 15 to 20, and the bull's eye before the opponent does. To
        close a number, a player must score three of that number (any combination of singles doubles and triples).

        <div class="header"> 2. Scoring</div>
        Once a player closes a number every subsequent score on that number increases their score, unless the other
        player has closed that number as well.
        <div class="header">3. Play & Win</div>
        The player who has closed all numbers and whose score is not lower than the opponent's, wins the game.

        Each player starts with X-01 (301, 501, 701) points. The number of points collected while hitting a board with a
        dart is
        subtracted from the given player's points. The winner is the player who scores exactly 0 points that way.
        Double-Out means that players must hit a double that makes their score exactly zero to win
        the game.
        <div class="header">2. Bust</div>
        In case of a bust the player's score from the previous turn is restored. There is bust if one of the following
        events arise:
        <ul>
          <li>The player scores more points in the active turn, than his current score (subtracting would result in a
            negative
            score)</li>
          <li>The player has 1 point after subtracting (you cannot score 1 with double out)</li>
          <li>The player has 0 point after subtracting but violates the double-out rule</li>
        </ul>
        <div class="header">3. End of the game</div>
        Players continue playing until one of them scores 0 points in total. The player who does so, wins the game.

        The aim of this game is to be the first player to hit all the numbers on the dart board from 1 - 20 and bullseye. Any segment
        of the number - single, double or triple - counts as a hit. The numbers must be hit in order, and players change
        after three throws. A player cannot pass or skip certain numbers, they must hit it to advance to the next number
        on the board.

        The Challenge Mode is designed to improve your dart-skills. <br>
        The app suggests numbers that you have to hit. If you hit the right number, press "Hit". If you have missed it,
        you press "Miss".
        <br>
        Your average hit rate will be calculated and saved, so you can fight against your highscore.
        The Hard-Mode contains more triple and double numbers.
