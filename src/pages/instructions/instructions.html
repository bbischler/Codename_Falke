        <div class="header"> 1. Aim of the game</div>
        The object of Cricket is to close all numbers from 15 to 20, and the bull's eye before the opponent does. To
        close a number, a player must score three of that number (any combination of singles doubles and triples).

        <div class="header"> 2. Scoring</div>
        Once a player closes a number every subsequent score on that number increases their score, unless the other
        player has closed that number as well.
        <div class="header">3. Play & Win</div>
        The player who has closed all numbers and whose score is not lower than the opponent's, wins the game. The
        player
        who has the highest score when 20 turns are over, wins the game. If the scores are tied after the 20th turn,
        the
        player who has closed the more numbers wins. If the number of the closed numbers is equal, there are 10
        possible
        extra turns to decide the winner.

        Each player starts with X-01 (301, 501, 701) points. The number of points collected while hitting a board with a
        dart is
        subtracted from the given player's points. The winner is the player who scores exactly 0 points that way.
        It is a double out game, which means that players must hit a double that makes their score exactly zero to win
        the game.
        <div class="header">Bust</div>
        In case of a bust the player's score from the previous turn is restored. There is bust if one of the following
        events arise:
        <ul>
          <li>The player scores more points in the active turn, than his current score (subtracting would result in a
            negative
            score)</li>
          <li>The player has 1 point after subtracting (you cannot score 1 with double out)</li>
          <li>The player has 0 point after subtracting but violates the double-out rule</li>
        </ul>
        <div class="header">End of the game</div>
        Players continue playing until one of them scores 0 points in total. The player who does so, wins the game.
        If none of the players gets to zero in 20 turns, the player with the lower point wins.
        If the scores are equal after 20 turns, the game will continue for another possible 10 turns.
        During these extra turns, the player who gets to zero obviously wins. A player with lower score any time after
        the 20th turn also wins the match.
        If the scores are equal after 20+10 turns, the match will end in a draw.
